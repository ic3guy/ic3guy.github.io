With the announcement that github pages now supports [Jekyll 3.0](https://jekyllrb.com/), I decided it was time to refresh my blog. As well, it looks like the online github markdown editor [prose.io](http://prose.io) has been updated as well and is much less buggy than I remember. Github flavoured markdown, including fenced code blocks, is now supported natively! Woo! Hoo!
