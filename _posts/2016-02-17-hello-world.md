With the announcement that github pages now supports Jekyll 3.0, I decided it was time to refresh my blog. As well, it looks like prose.io has been updated as well. It should be a lot simpler now that this is done. Github flavoured markdown, including fenced code blocks, is now supported natively! Woo! Hoo!
