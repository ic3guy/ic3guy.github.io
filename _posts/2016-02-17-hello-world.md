With the announcement that github pages now supports [Jekyll 3.0](https://jekyllrb.com/), I decided it was time to refresh my blog. As well, it looks like an online github markdown editor [prose.io](prose.io) has been updated as well and is much less buggy. As well Github flavoured markdown, including fenced code blocks, is now supported natively! Woo! Hoo!
