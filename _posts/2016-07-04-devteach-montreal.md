## On the way to DevTeach Montreal 2016

I am currently waiting at YVR to take a plane to wonderful Montreal. I am heading to [DevTeach](http://www.devteach.com/) a web development conference being held at the Omni Hotel. I am excited about learning somethings about AngularJS 2.0 and other webby things. The goal is to have a blog post a day describing which sessions I attended and some of the things I have learned.
