In September 2016 I happened upon [this article](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/20/chinese-school-in-chinatown-focuses-on-survival-cantonese.html) about a survival "Saturday School" Cantonese class starting up in Vancouver. Considering I have been with my wife for almost 12 years, I figured it was about time I learn more than just my please and thank you's. I had to be quick. There were only 4 spaces left when I booked my spot and by the end of the day they were completely full and had a waiting list of over 70 students!

The class ran from Oct 1 and Dec 3 and was setup by the [Youth Collaborative For Chinatown](http://ycc-yvr.com/). Besides learning some basic conversational Cantonese, we spent half our time learning about the history of Chinatown in Vancouver as well as putting a lot of the issues facing the Chinese community into context. We were also taken on several field trips to important and significant locations in and around Chinatown.
