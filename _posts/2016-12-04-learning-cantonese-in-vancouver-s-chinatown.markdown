In September 2016 I happened upon [this article](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/09/20/chinese-school-in-chinatown-focuses-on-survival-cantonese.html) about a survival "Saturday School" Cantonese class starting up in Vancouver. Considering I have been with my wife for almost 12 years, I figured it was about time I learn more than just my please and thank you's. I had to be quick. There were only 4 spaces left when I booked my spot and by the end of the day they were completely full and had a waiting list of over 70 students!

The class ran from Oct 1 and Dec 3 and was setup by the [Youth Collaborative For Chinatown](http://ycc-yvr.com/). Besides learning some basic conversational Cantonese, we spent half our time learning about the history of Chinatown in Vancouver as well as putting a lot of the issues facing the Chinese community into context. We were also taken on several field trips to important and significant locations in and around Chinatown.

## Resurrecting the Mon Keang language school

One of the first things I learned was about the existence of **clan societies**. These would be associations of people coming together either by last name (Lee, Wong, Ing), region hailed from (Toi San, Hoiping) and other benevolent/fraternal associations (Chinese freemasons).

There are many reasons these groups exist, but one of the most important is utility. When chinese men came to North America for work in the late 1800's and early 1900's there was an incredible amount of racism that limited the ability to settle and conduct day to day activities. Banks would not do business with you. Landlords would not rent to you. These clan societies filled this need. They develop the networks to transfer money back to China, as well as to other family members in San Francisco and Toronto. Together with their founding members, the societies were able to buy property to offer services to their members, notably housing. 

Another important function that was set up by the societies was language schools. It was easy for children to pick up conversational Cantonese in the household from family. But it was much more difficult to learn to read and write. It was incredibly important for the early immigrants that their children be completely literate in Chinese because of the continual fear that the immigration policies could suddenly change and everyone would be deported back to China. The Mon Keang School (established 1925) was setup by the Wong Benevolent Society to teach reading and writing, initially to the members children. 

The pupils would usually come to school every day after regular school or after supper. It was quite grueling since the focus was learning via rote memorisation. Over time language schools transitioned to a weekend class model. I remember when I was younger, many of my chinese friends absolutely *hated* chinese school on the weekends. Many gave it up and now cannot read or write chinese. As time when on, the Mon Keang school had slowly dwindling class sizes. It closed its doors in 2011.

A sad end, but onto new beginnings! The language school organized by the Youth Collaborative For Chinatown was held again in the Mon Keang school. We sat on the same chairs and used the same desks. It was a little tight for my 6"2 frame, but it made it all the more special. The return of the school is an important step in returning bodies to Chinatown.
