## Day 1

### Introduction to Visual Studio CODE

What I particularly liked about this talk was showing how easy it it is to install plugins/extensions into VS Code. The speaker also highlighted how the text search capabilities of it are good. You operate on a folder. There is a clear delineation between a project and text editor settings. Everything is stored in a .vscode folder. There was also a very good Markdown side by side preview. The file size is a very big plus.

Still does not support all the refactoring power of Resharper. But it is getting there.

Perhaps not a drop down replacement, but much better than Notepad++. 

### Introduction to Typescript

Introduces types.
Transpiles from Typescript into ES6/ES5

Can target whatever javascript you want.
