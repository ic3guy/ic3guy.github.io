I am attending [VSLive 2017](https://vslive.com/Events/Las-Vegas-2017/Home.aspx) in lovely Las Vegas. It should be a great conference given that Visual Studio 2017 was just launched a few days ago. Hopefully I will make some good contacts and learn about some new technologies.

The hashtag for the event is [#vslive](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=#VSLive&src=tyah)
